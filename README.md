Analysis 

Overall, the highest performing schools consisted of only Charter schools, while the lowest performing schools consisted of only District schools. From there, the results in the "School Summary" section highlighted the fact that the District school produced significantly lower average test scores than the Charter schools. In addition, the Charter schools had a lower per student budget, showing a negative correlation between budget and average test scores for the District schools. The "Schools by Spending" section shows this a little better: As the budget per student went up, the average test scores went down. 
The "Schools by Size" section indicates that the smaller the school, the better the test scores. This observation could mean that smaller schools better allocate their resources to the individual students to allow them to perform well, while larger schools do not.
